## The Basics

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with the following metadata syntax with `---` at the start and end:

```plaintext /title/1
---
title: [title of the page]
---
```

Other metadata goes in between the same --- lines. For example, this page uses this metadata:

```plaintext /title/1 /description/1
---
title: "Page Titles and Metadata"
description: "Metadata is important for API pages and SEO optimization"
---
```

## Description

You can show a description that shows directly under the title with the description metadata.

```plaintext /description/1
description: "Your description goes here."
```

### Sidebar Title

You can show a different title in the navigation with the sidebarTitle metadata. This is useful if your title is long and you want something shorter in the navigation links.

```plaintext /title/1 /sidebarTitle/1
---
title: "Your very long page title you want to shorten"
sidebarTitle: "Short title"
---
```
