# Main methods

Here's a quick guide to using Chamber in your app:

## Logging Messages

This method stores your messages and associate them with a key.

```dart
Chamber.log("User logged in successfully", "auth");
Chamber.log("This is a general log message"); // Defaults to "general" key.
```

## Retrieving Logs

This method retrieves your messages. You can get all of them by leaving the `key` parameter as `null`.

```dart
List<String> authLogs = Chamber.get("auth");
List<String> generalLogs = Chamber.get();
```

## Clearing Logs

This method clears your messages. You can also clear all of them by leaving the `key` parameter as `null`.

```dart
Chamber.clear("auth"); // Clears only 'auth' logs.
Chamber.clear(); // Clears all logs.
```

## Displaying Logs

This method pops up a dialog in your app with the log messages. You can use the `key` parameter to display only specific ones.

```dart
Chamber.clear("auth"); // Clears only 'auth' logs.
Chamber.clear(); // Clears all logs.
```
