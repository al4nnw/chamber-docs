## Getting Started with Zidocs

Welcome to the Zidocs documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and supercharge your documentation with the advanced features Zidocs offers.

### 1. Deploying Your Docs Repository

Zidocs docs are rendered from MDX files and configurations defined in our starter template. We use Github to integrate your docs with your code, and make source control effortless.

<Accordion icon="github" title="Creating Your Documentation Repository">
  If you’ve created a docs repo in our onboarding, this step is complete. You can find your docs repository on your Zidocs dashboard.
        
  To create your docs repo without logging into Github, follow these instructions:

  1. Clone our [starter-kit](https://github.com/zidocs/starter-kit) into a new public repo. You can make the repo private later.
  2. Get in touch with our team to deploy your repo.
</Accordion>

### 2. Updating Your Docs

Zidocs enables you to easily customize the style, structure, and content of your docs.

### 3. Supercharging Your Docs

Zidocs supports an array of advanced features like API reference docs, analytics, and versioning to accommodate any of your documentation needs.

### All Done!
